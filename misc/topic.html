<h3><u>Technology/Topic Selection</h3></u>
<p>Information technology is growing rapidly, and huge amounts of data circulate the internet every second.
 During the year 2020, 64.2 zettabytes of data was created, copied, and stored. 
By 2025, itâ€™s forecast that 181 zettabytes of data will be consumed during 2025 alone,
 that is just over 5.5 million gigabytes, every second.

 A considerable proportion of this data is collected, examined and observed by Governments across the world.
The US Government has successfully utilised the massive amounts of data it collects to stop crimes
 and extremist attacks before they happen. However, there is a major dispute about whether the implications
 on human rights and infringements on your privacy are worth it. we chose this topic to further study the implications
 of US government surveillance on Privacy and Human rights.

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>
