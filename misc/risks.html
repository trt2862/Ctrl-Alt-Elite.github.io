<h3><u>Technology Risks</h3></u>
<p>There comes many risks associated with mass data surveillance. The chances of data leaks are extraordinarily highas cybercrime becomes more and more prominent. Such as the 2015 data breach of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that saw over 21 million records of past and present federal employees stolen (Baecker 2019). This showed a total lack of data security on behalf of the government and is a sound example why “once governments have our personal information, we have lost control of it” (Baecker 2019).
Soon after the events of 9/11 the US had developed into a so called, ‘surveillance state’. The National Security Agency (NSA) saw huge boosts in funding, and many top-secret programs like ‘Stellar Wind’ began collecting colossal amounts of metadata on unaware individuals, such as IP addresses from emails, phone calls and many other forms of communication data (Savage, C. 2015), in hopes to thwart the next potential terrorist threat.
<p>Not only that, after 9/11 the Department of Homeland Security requested data on ‘Arab-Americans’ living in certain area codes from the Census Bureau, the Census claimed the data transfer was to decide which airports should have signs in Arabic. However, this raised suspicions that the information was being used to profile Middle Eastern people over concerns of a terrorist attack (Baecker 2019). 
Although it is hard to gauge the true effectiveness of mass data collection, there are claims it is deemed ineffective considering the huge number of resources it requires, so perhaps higher security would be the more appropriate approach?  
Overall, it appears there comes many risks of data surveillance if it is managed by the wrong hands, and although these risks are great, there comes many positive opportunities that must be discussed.
