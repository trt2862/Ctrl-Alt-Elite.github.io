<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the choices available to us through or by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<h4><p>With the choices that come with government surveillance, there are a few that are being incorporated. Such as increasing airport security, by running checks on passports etc, countries are able to see where the person comes from, if their identity is real and to prevent any sort of crime coming into the country. However, in the USA, they mainly screen those who look ‘foreign’ or capable of doing such a crime like terrorism. This is particularly due to the 9/11 attacks and how it affected the people of the country, they are bound to check anyone that looks the part. However, it does not protect anyone as even a white cis male can be a terrorist, and therefore, they are not thorough with the checks. 
Apart from that, most jobs require mobile phones and even provide work phones for each employee. The employer is able to locate and make sure each person is doing their task and not mucking around. Along with that, they can see how much progress each employee does and manage from there. </p></h4>
